# add comments to the project
# try to make the index file more beautiful to look at
# add the choice to loop throw all the files in the collection but the index itself
# you should also filter the words from the " or the one for coats and the dots : and = and > and < and => and ; and â€¢
# and , etc...
# in short build another method and make sure to clean the delivered word from those things
# in the assignment he is saying "positional index written" does that mean we should store the position of the word too?
